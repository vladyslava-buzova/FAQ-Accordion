                Full-time and self-paced formats have exactly the same 
                program and objective result to get you employed.
                The difference is only in your schedule and a form of payment.

                After graduating from our courses, you will get a certificate of completion.
                1800+ of our graduates use their certificates to demonstrate their skills on LinkedIn and other socials.
                Our main goal with students is not earning a certificate but a job offer. And we will do our best to ensure that every student receives one.
